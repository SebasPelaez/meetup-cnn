# Introduction to convolutional neuronal networks

This repository contains slides and resources for my presentation on Medell√≠n Machine Learning Meetup.

The Jupytet Notebooks AlexNetArchitecture and ExampleArchitecture are developed with Keras API, but the ResNetArchitecture is totally developed with TensorFlow. These files show you one way to define a model architecture.

The HTML has the slides of the presentation. If you want to see it, you also visit this link https://slides.com/sebaspelaez/introduccion-a-las-redes-neuronales-convolucionales#/
